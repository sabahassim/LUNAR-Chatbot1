# üåô LUNAR - AI Mental Wellness Chatbot

## Description

Users can share their feelings by selecting emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Anxious, or Excited. Luna adapts her responses based on the user‚Äôs emotional state, guiding the conversation from negative or neutral moods to positive and uplifting interactions. The chatbot is context-aware, remembers recent conversation history, and responds naturally, creating a supportive and friendly chat experience.

## Key Features
- Detects user-selected emotions with emojis for clarity.
- Classifies sentiments as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
